# Project Title

SetAccount

## Project Description

SetAccount is a terminal app to set accounts and profiles for a service. 
This is my first Ruby terminal app and is still under development.

## Getting Started

In the first screen you can create a new account or sign in if the account has been previously created.
(At the moment the app doesn't store any data from previous sessions, but I am going to implement it in the future). 
After creating an account you will be prompted to input the account's email and password in order to sign in.
Once signed in you can create, edit and delete profiles as well as choose the one to sign in with.

## Gems

The only gem implemented at the moment is: 
[Colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize) - Used to change the color of text in the console

## Future Implementations

* Date validation
* Profile configuration
